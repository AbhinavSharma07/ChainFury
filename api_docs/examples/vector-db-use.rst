Vector Database
===============

A vector database is a type of database that stores data in a vector format, meaning that each data point is represented
as a vector in a high-dimensional space. This allows for efficient querying and processing of data using vector-based
algorithms, such as vector similarity searches and clustering. Vector databases are particularly useful for applications
that involve large amounts of text, image, or audio data, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and
speech recognition.

Embeddings are commonly used for:

* Search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
* Clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
* Recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended)
* Anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
* Diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
* Classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)
